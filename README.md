# Sindie Castro

## Welcome

Hello World! My name is Sindie Castro. I'm very excited to introduce you to my data analysis side, or my wild side as I like to call it!

## Other Interests

When I am not analysing data, I'm either dancing, binge watching Netflix, or spending time with my family.

## Expand My Skills

I'm open to collaborating on projects or helping others with their projects. Let me know how I can help. I'm trying to expand my skills to focus on Python, SQL, and Power BI. I would not mind an HTML or JavaScript challenge or learn about any projects you are working on. My brain is always thirty for knowledge.
